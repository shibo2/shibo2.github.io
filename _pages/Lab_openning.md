The Computational Learning Lab at Zhengzhou University is looking for students to work on the design and evaluation of cross modal learning and virtual reality techniques.  Our current work involves studies of emotion recognition, fake information detection, fine grained object recognition, deep reinforcement learning and crowd simulation. We are in general interested in understanding how feelings and emotions mechanism can improve scientists' ability to convert data into understanding and aim to high fidelity human individual and group simulation. We study cross modal learning solutions and design new simulation metaphors. 

Relevant Skills 
===
We rarely look for applicants from any specific area of science, but rather for scholars with unusual drive, creativity, scientific rigor and independence. Often, you must have had a degree in or related to computer science. Skills in visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, VR, data analysis, math, and physics tend to be more useful than others. The work in the lab has been highly interdisciplinary. However, someone with math or physics background can be strong experimental and others with strong programing and tool building experience can pick up the scientific side. Both scholar types have in fact been successful in the lab. The two examples are by no means complete. If you read our papers and feel an intellectual kinship with how we do science, that may be the best indicator of a fit.
